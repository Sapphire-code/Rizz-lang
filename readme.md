# The programming language that will *Rizz* your programs up ;)

### Usage:
To use the programming language, first install ![Python](https://www.python.org/)
After installing python, make sure it is added to PATH on your device, otherwise using this language will become much harder.

Once you've setup everything, go ahead and clone the GitHub repository.

### Running a hello world program:
the interpreter comes with a built-in hello world program in the demo folder. 
Here's the code:
```
>IIIIIIII{
    <IIIIIIIII>R
    }<Z>IIII {
        <IIIIIII>R
        }<IZIIIIIIIZZIIIZ>>IIIIII {
            <IIIIIII>R
            }<I
IZRRRRRRRRRRRRZ>IIIIII {
    <IIIIIIIII>R
    }<IZ<ZIIIZRRRRRRZRRRRRRRRZ>>>IIII {
        <IIIIIIII>R
}<IZ
```

To run:
`python.exe rizz.py run`

The program will **ask** you for the file path of the respective `.rizz` file, provide the **complete path** to make sure it reads the file correctly.
````
Enter File path: demo\hello_world.rizz
Hello, World!
````

### Code Converter.
The interpreter comes with a built-in converter, if you didn't already figure it out the language is based on another language called ![brainf**k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
The converter allows Rizz to be converted to brainf**k and vice versa, a built-in python converter is also available.

#### To use the converter:
`python.exe rizz.py convert`<br>
Guide:
````
rizz2bf -> Allows conversion of rizz code to brainf**k code.
bf2rizz -> Allows conversion of brainf**k code to rizz code.
rizz2python -> Allows conversion of rizz code to python code.
````

### This is a complete joke!
The programming language was made as a joke, it purely will be a joke, and nothing more. The repository will be **maintained** as **newer python versions** come along with changes.
